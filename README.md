## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Favorite Apps & Features:

   - Adding filters to images  

2. **Spotify**

### App Idea:

I would like to build an app that helps users track their daily habits, such as exercising, drinking water, or reading. The app would have features like:
- A daily checklist where users can mark completed habits.
- A progress tracker with visual graphs.
- Reminders to motivate users to complete their tasks.

This app could be a helpful tool for anyone looking to stay on top of their goals and build consistency in their daily routines.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
